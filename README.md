Builds are automatically triggered on `tduck973564/filotimo-packages` COPR, when a specfile in this repository is pushed to.
Update version numbers when source contents change and you want to release those changes.

Where sources are not kept in the same directory as the specfile, sources are from `filotimo-linux/core-package-sources` repository. COPR downloads tarballs from the releases there and builds using this.
